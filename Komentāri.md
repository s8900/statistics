## Definīcijas
### Inferential statistics
- **sample** is a smaller group of data, which is a portion, or a subset, of a **population**
---
### Averages, also called **measures of central tendency** 
- **mean** - is simply the sum of all the values in a group, divided by the number of values in that group. $$\overline{X} = \frac{\sum X}{n}$$
> **$\overline{X}$** *(X bar)* -  is the mean value of the group of scores or the mean
> 
> **$\sum$** *(Greek letter sigma)* - is the summation sign, which tells you to add together whatever follows it
> 
> **X** - each individual score in the group of scores
> 
> **n** - the size of the sample from which you are computing the mean

- **median** - defined as the midpoint in a set of scores; It’s the point at which one half, or 50%, of the scores fall above and one half, or 50%, fall below.
- **mode** - he value that occurs most frequently.
  - bimodal (with two modes)
 ---
### Four scales of measurement
- **nominal** is defined by the characteristics of an outcome that fit into one and only one class or category
  - For example, gender can be a nominal variable (female and male), as can ethnicity (Caucasian or African American), as can political affiliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent)
  - Nominal levels of measurement have categories that are mutually exclusive
> Šajā piemērā nomināli dati tiek attēloti kā viens vai otrs vārds, bet vai var būt vairāki ?
- **ordianl** stands for order, and the characteristic of things being measured here is that they are ordered
  - The perfect example is a rank of candidates for a job. If we know that Russ is ranked #1, Sheldon is ranked #2, and Hannah is ranked #3, then this is an ordinal arrangement
  - We just know that it’s “better” to be #1 than #2 than #3, but not by how much.
- **interval** -  a test or an assessment tool is based on some underlying continuum such that we can talk about how much more a higher performance is than a lesser one.
- **ratio** -  is characterized by the presence of an absolute zero on the scale
> Any outcome can be assigned to one of four scales of measurement.
>
> Scales of measurement have an order, from the least precise being nominal to the most
precise being ratio
>
> The “higher up” the scale of measurement, the more precise the data being collected,
and the more detailed and informative the data are.
>
> Finally, the more precise scales contain all the qualities of the scales below them; for
example, the interval scale includes the characteristics of the ordinal and nominal
scales. I
